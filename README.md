# road-to-frontend
My attempt at crash coursing this probably common journey at understanding modern frontend development. Mind you that i've been doing web/system related development for almost 8 years, but it feels like I barely scratched many of them. I've heard and used some of these tools, but my fundemantal for frontend is still like super behind. For eg. I never really used build tools before, or built a frontend app from scratch before. These are from my understanding, so please don't mind me, but help me.

So, introducing frontend from super basic.
