# road-to-frontend
My attempt at crash coursing this probably common journey at understanding modern frontend development. Mind you that i've been doing web/system related development for almost 8 years, but it feels like I barely scratched many of them. I've heard and used many of these tools, but my fundemantal for frontend is still like super behind. For eg. I never really used build tools before, or built a frontend app from scratch before. These are from my understanding, so please don't mind me, but help me.

So, introducing frontend from super basic.

## Chapter 0 : HTML, CSS, Javascript
- what are they
- the state of cross-platform app development
  - history of node.js
  - phone-gap, cordova, electron, ionic, react-native
## Chapter 1 : ES6
- import export
- script types
## Chapter 2 : NPM
- package.json
- package install
- package scripts
- ngx
## Build tools
- huh?
## Chapter 3 : Webpack
- config
- building up your modules
- webpack config/structures
## Chapter 4 : Modern Project Structure
for framework like vue, angular, react, svelte
